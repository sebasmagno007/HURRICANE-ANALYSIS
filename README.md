#Hurricane Analysis

This is CodeAcademy project which provides 7 lists about important Hurricanes in the last 100 years with several information, the objective is to create functions that make dictionaries and modify this dictionarys to provide new dictionaries or specific results, expecting to facilitate further analysis:

- The damages list was updated to convert prefix values to integers and kept "Damages not Recorded".
- With the new damages list a dictionary was constructed with keys as the names of the hurricanes, and values as subdictionaries where key is the list name provided and value is the proper value according to the Hurricane.
- Convert the main dictionary in a new dictionary, where the main keys are years.
- Determine how often each area is listed.
- A function to determine the area affected by most hurricanes, and how often hit.
- A function to determine the hurricane causing most deaths, and how many it caused.
- Rate hurricanes on mortality scale in a new dictionary, with key as rating and value as name of the hurricane.
- A function to determine the hurricane causing greatest damage, and how costly it was.
- Rate hurricanes on damage scale in a new dictionary, with key as rating and value as name of the hurricane.
